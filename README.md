# Deforestation Trends in the Amazon Rainforest

## Project Overview
This project visualizes and analyzes deforestation trends in the Amazon Rainforest using data from the Global Forest Change dataset by Hansen et al., accessed via Google Earth Engine (GEE). The goal is to provide insights into forest cover loss from 2000 to 2023.

## Objective
- Visualize degree of deforestation using a map showing areas  affected by deforestation between years 2000-2023 in Tableau .
- Quantify degree of deforestation.

## Technologies Used
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Google Earth Engine**: For data extraction and preprocessing.
- **Global Forest Change Dataset**: Source of deforestation data.

## Data Extraction
The Hansen data was extracted from Google Earth Engine using the script `hansen_data_extraction.js`. Follow these steps to obtain the data:
1. Set up Google Earth Engine (GEE) account and environment.
2. Run the `hansen_data_extraction.js` script to export data.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Download the Data**: Use the GEE script to export the dataset. Follow GEE documentation for setting up and running scripts.
2. **Open Tableau Workbook**: Open `Tableau_Workbook.twbx` in Tableau Desktop to interact with the dashboards.

## Usage Instructions
1. Open `Tableau_Workbook.twbx` in Tableau Desktop.
2. Explore the sheets to analyze deforestation patterns and trends.
